# TeleportDAO Protocol V1

This repository contains the smart contracts for the TeleportDAO bridge, cross-chain transfer, and cross-chain exchange. The codes belong to connecting Bitcoin to EVM-based blockchains. The repository uses Hardhat as development environment for compilation, testing and deployment tasks.

## What is Teleport?

Teleport is a trustless and universal protocol that provides an infrastructure for developers to build cross-chain applications. In other words, Teleport helps blockchains communicate with each other. Applications on one blockchain can access the latest data on other blockchains using Teleport relay smart contract.
